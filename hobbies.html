    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised here in Reno, NV. I was a fairly active child and loved exploring Reno on my bike. I've also walked
        all around the city during my years in high school, which probably helped me in cross country. If you can't tell already,
        I like to keep busy. I have a wonderful family that is made of a beatuiful wife, two beautiful girls of my own, three
        gorgeous corgis (all girls), and a loving black cat (also girl). I'm outnumbered but I don't mind it.
        <br>
        I also like to play video games, listen to music, and working around the house that me and my wife own. We enjoy going
        out as a family and go camping every year. We also just got into paddle boards, so next summer is going to be a blast.

    <h2>Professional</h2>
    <p>When I first got into the work force, I started in a small fancy restraunt in Reno. I was a dishwasher and vowed to never be
        a dishwasher again. Then I spent a brief moment in entertainment/customer service at Roller Kingdom. I was the DJ! Then I worked at Sonic Drive-ins
        as a car hop. My last restraunt before I left the industry was Laughing Planet. It was a great place to work. I loved the people
        and was able to handle my responabilities.
        <br>
        I left Laughing Planet and started in warehouse. Working in e-commerce at a warehouse for Chewy.com! I went into warehousing
        because my oldest daughter was born. I needed to start a career and earn more to support my family. I learned how to drive my first
        PIT there, and when I left I learned a reach truck. That was a lucky break, because it earned me a spot at PetSmart DC41.
        That job had the most influence on me as a person, a worker, and a parent. It shaped me by having a structure and culture like no 
        other job did. They offered alot of support and growth.
        <br>
        Unfortunatly my tenure came to an end. It was just before Christmas so I couldn't find a place by the time peak season had eneded.
        I couldn't find many places, until I found Amazon. I got a job as a Delivery driver in the month of February. I've been there for 
        less than a year, but I've already experienced a lot! But it's what brings me to today. I want to learn software development.
        I put in effort each and every day to work on myself.

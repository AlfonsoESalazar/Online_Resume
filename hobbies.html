    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised here in Reno, NV. I was a fairly active child and loved exploring Reno on my bike. I've also walked
        all around the city during my years in high school, which probably helped me in cross country. If you can't tell already,
        I like to keep busy. I have a wonderful family that is made of a beautiful wife, two beautiful daughters, three
        gorgeous corgis (all girls), and a loving black cat (also girl). I'm outnumbered but I don't mind it.
        <br>
        I also like to play video games, listen to music, and work around the house that my wife and I own. We enjoy going
        out as a family and go camping every year. We also just got into paddle boarding, so next summer is going to be a blast.

    <h2>Professional</h2>
    <p>When I first got into the work force, I started in a small fancy restraunt in Reno. I was a dishwasher and vowed to never be
        a dishwasher again. Then I spent a brief moment in entertainment/customer service at Roller Kingdom. Then I worked at Sonic Drive-ins
        as a car hop. My last restraunt before I left the industry was Laughing Planet. It was a great place to work. I loved the people
        and excelled at my responsibilities.
        <br>
        I left Laughing Planet and started in warehousing. I worked in e-commerce at a warehouse for Chewy.com! I was ready for a career. I learned how to drive my first
        PIT there and when I left I learned how to operate reach truck. A year later I landed a career at PetSmart DC41, joining the RSR team as a reach trick driver.
        <br>
        Unfortunatly my tenure at PetSmart came to an end. It was just before Christmas so I couldn't find a place by the time peak season had eneded.
        I couldn't find many places until I found Amazon. I got a job as a Delivery driver in the month of February. I've been there for 
        less than a year but I've already experienced a lot! Currently I want to learn software development, and I'm building a portfolio with each coding project.
